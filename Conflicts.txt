1. How I resolved the text conflict

Working with two users, Paul and Sina, Paul implemented his "Sum" method and pushed it to the repository. But when Sina implemented her "Dif" method we had two code versions
implemented on the same lines, I pulled the most recent version from the repository and then using Visual Studio I merged the changes keeping both methods and pushed it
in the repository.

2. How I resolved the missing file conflict

Paul created a new file and commited it into the repository. Sina decided to delete the new file and commit the changes again. I edited the new file with the user Paul
but when I tried to pull the latest changes, the file was missing and I got a missing/modified file conflict. I resolved the conflict using Virtual Studio. I decided to
keep the file and commited the file with the new changes into the repository.
